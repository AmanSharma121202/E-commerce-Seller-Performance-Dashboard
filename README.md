E-commerce Seller Performance Dashboard
This project is an interactive analytics dashboard built with Python, Streamlit, Pandas, and Plotly. It simulates and visualizes e-commerce seller performance, focusing on key metrics, cohort analysis, and customer segmentation to provide actionable business insights.

(Note: Replace the placeholder above with a screenshot of your actual dashboard.)

Features
Overall Performance KPIs: At-a-glance metrics for total revenue, total profit, total sellers, and overall return rate.

Monthly Performance Trends: An interactive line chart visualizing monthly revenue and profit to identify trends and seasonality.

Seller Cohort Analysis: A heatmap that groups sellers by their join month to track their average profit over time, helping to understand seller retention and long-term value.

Seller Segmentation: Uses K-Means clustering to segment sellers into four distinct groups based on their performance (e.g., "Top Performers", "At-Risk") and provides actionable recommendations for each group.

Tech Stack
Python: Core programming language.

Streamlit: To build and serve the interactive web dashboard.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Plotly: For creating interactive data visualizations.

Scikit-learn: For implementing the K-Means clustering algorithm.

NumPy: For numerical operations and data simulation.

Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

Clone the repository (or create a project folder):

git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-dashboard.git
cd ecommerce-dashboard

Install the required libraries:
Make sure you have Python installed. Then, run the following command in your terminal to install all necessary dependencies.

pip install -r requirements.txt

(Note: Ensure you have a requirements.txt file in your repository with the library names.)

How to Run the Project
Generate the Synthetic Data:
Before running the dashboard for the first time, you need to generate the sellers.csv and orders.csv files.

python generate_data.py

Run the Streamlit Dashboard:
Once the data is generated, start the Streamlit application.

streamlit run dashboard.py

A new tab will automatically open in your web browser at http://localhost:8501, displaying the interactive dashboard.
